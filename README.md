# Torghast, Tower of Chastity

Oh no! The Dutchess of Cock-Block has rounded up all of the mightiest Wizard Boners from around the land and locked them away in Torghast, Tower of Chastity.

But all hope is not lost, intrepid adventurer. You hold with you (Enrique) Iglesias, Key To the Crotch. Iglesias holds the power to free all Wizard Boners from the clutches of the tower. Unfortunately, due to the evil Dutchesses interference, the key lies in ruins.

Your job is to use all of your mastery and skills to repair the key so that it may unlock the magical **heart**, **mind** and **spirit** tumblers that keep all of our land's boners behind lock and key.

More specifically, you will need to finish writing the smart contract `contract/IglesiasKeyToTheCrotch` and deploy it to unlock **YOUR OWN PERSONAL LIMITED EDITION FIRST OF ITS CLASS WIZARD BONER!!!!!**

## Installation

Clone this repo and run:

`yarn install`

You will also want to add two environment variables to your shell environment:

```
ETH_ADDRESS={YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS}
ETH_MNEMONIC={YOUR_SEED_PHRASE_FROM_METAMASK}
```

## Workflow

This repository has a full test suite that you can develop against to unlock the tumblers and free the boners. 

The interesting files are `contract/IglesiasKeyToTheCrotch.sol`, `contract/TorghastTowerOfChastity` and `test/1_test_torghast.js`, although all of the changes you will need to make are to `contract/IglesiasKeyToTheCrotch.sol` .

You can run the tests with:

 `yarn run test`

Once all of the tests are green, you can hit me up and I'll walk you through the deploy, since they cost money and can be wasteful if things go wrong.
